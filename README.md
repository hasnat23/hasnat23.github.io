# Muhammad Hasnat — Full-Stack Software Engineer (GitHub Pages Portfolio)

A fast, accessible, and mobile-first portfolio you can host with **GitHub Pages**.

## Quick start

1. Create a repository named **`<your-username>.github.io`** on GitHub.
2. Upload the contents of this folder to that repository (keep files at the repo root).
3. On GitHub, go to **Settings → Pages → Build and deployment → Source: Deploy from a branch**. Choose `main` and `/ (root)`; save.
4. Open `https://<your-username>.github.io` in a few minutes.

To customize, edit:
- `site.config.json` (name, role, email, social links, resume url)
- `projects.json` (your featured projects — add `details`, `live`, `highlight`, `tags`)
- `experiences.json` (roles shown on the Experience section)
- `index.html` sections (minor layout changes)

> Docs: GitHub Pages quickstart and configuration — see links in the footer of `index.html`.

## Local preview
Just open `index.html` in a browser, or use a simple server:

```bash
python3 -m http.server 8000
```
